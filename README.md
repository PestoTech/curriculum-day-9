# Day 9

There are separate branches for Segment 1 and Segment 2 in this repository. Both segments include two things:

1) Coding exercises

2) Written/Multiple Choice questions

The reason for two separate branches for two segments is to have separate test suites run on travis CI.

### Instructions:

1) Fork this repo.

2) Clone the repo using
  ```
    git clone <link to forked repo>
  ```

3) Change directory
  ```
    cd <Folder Name>
  ```

4) Install dependencies
  ```
    yarn
  ```

5) To do the exercises in branch `segment-1`
  ```
    git fetch origin segment-1
    git checkout segment-1
  ```

6) Do your work and then push to the branch
  ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "your commit message"
    git push origin segment-1
  ```

7) Create pull request (against segment-1 branch) by clicking on pull request option
on your forked repo.

8) Repeat steps 5-7 for `segment-2`.
